# Clarifaction Viewer for Khan Academy

The Clarification Viewer is a web app, which allows users to view and filter clarifications on Khan Academy content. Users can view clarifications for any topic in any language supported Khan Academy. Clarifications can also be filtered and sorted: date created, votes, or user created tags. The app also includes a permissions system to prevent unauthorized users from tagging clarifications or other potentially disruptive activity.

The app was created at the request of Khan Academy's content team and is being actively maintained and updated at their request.
